<p> You pray 5 times a day, right? Well I try to. And you pray for the same things everyday? I try to. Soemtimes I forget things, other times I'm reminded of things I should be grateful for, thankful for, should ask for or be forgiven for. Right now, I'm just praying that my past stops haunting me, that I have enough patience to wait for the good things coming my way, and that I am at peace with myself right now, sukoon. </p>
